# Ammeter Clock Project

A project to improve the 'ammeter clock' inherited from CJCK.

Currently driven using a crystal(?) oscillator driving a PIC and then an 8 bit D to A converter.

Change to use arduino and possibly an RTC. Or an RPi with wifi to get internet time.

Original hw failed in April 2023.
