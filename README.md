# Ammeter Clock Project

A project to improve the 'ammeter clock' inherited from CJCK.

Currently driven using a crystal(?) oscillator driving a PIC and then an 8 bit D to A converter.

Change to use arduino and possibly an RTC. Or an RPi with wifi to get internet time.

Original hw failed in April 2023.  But turned out that the internal batteries (4 off AAA) were at 4.87 V.  New set of batteries were 6.19 V and system function restored.  Removing the batteries altogether also restored function.  System reassembled with no batteries fitted. SCJK 23 April 2023.
